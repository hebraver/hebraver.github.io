              <p> I am interested in becoming an architect because I like math and It seems like an cool career. An architect works on public or private projects and designs both indoor and outdoor spaces. Architects can be commissioned to design anything from a single room to an entire complex of buildings. Architects discuss with clients the objectives, requirements, and budget of a project. In Chicago, there is a salary low of about 58k, a high of about 163k, and an average of about 97k. To become an architect, you need a professional degree in architecture from a National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) accredited program. This degree can be a Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch) or a Master of Architecture. The traits of an architect are the following: design skills and knowledge, knowledge of building and construction, to be thorough and pay attention to detail, thinking and reasoning skills, customer service skills, excellent verbal communication skills, analytical thinking skills, and the ability to use your initiative.</p>
